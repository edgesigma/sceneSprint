## Description

Improve the quality and robustness of individual features to provide a better foundation for matching. This involves refining the color analysis and how person counts are represented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Color histogram grid is increased to at least 4x4
- [x] Color histograms are calculated using the HSV color space
- [x] Raw person count is converted into a binned categorical feature
- [x] The output format of the feature extraction script is updated to include these new features

## Implementation Notes

- Refactored the feature extraction script (`process_step_1/context_aware_feature_extraction.py`) to focus on the core requirements of this task.
- Implemented a 4x4 grid-based color histogram using the HSV color space for more robust color representation.
- Added person count detection using MediaPipe and binned the result into a one-hot encoded feature (`[1,0,0,0]` for 0 people, etc.).
- The script now outputs a TSV file with the filename and the concatenated feature vector.
- Created unit and integration tests (`process_step_1/tests/test_feature_extraction.py`) to validate the new logic.
- All tests are passing.
- Modified files:
  - `process_step_1/context_aware_feature_extraction.py`
- Created files:
  - `process_step_1/tests/test_feature_extraction.py`
