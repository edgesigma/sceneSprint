## Description

To improve search relevance, add a 'context' feature ('indoor', 'outdoor', 'space', 'underwater') to poster vectors. This involves training a local image classifier using transfer learning and integrating it into the feature extraction pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Training script is created
- [ ] Model is trained and saved
- [ ] Feature extraction is updated with the new model
- [ ] FAISS index is rebuilt with new features
- [ ] Server works with the new index
- [ ] Documentation is updated
