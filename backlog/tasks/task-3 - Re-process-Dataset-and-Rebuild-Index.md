## Description

Regenerate the entire feature dataset and the FAISS index using the newly enhanced and weighted feature extraction pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The context_aware_poster_features.jsonl file is regenerated using the new feature extraction script
- [x] The context_aware_poster_index.faiss index is successfully rebuilt from the new feature file
- [x] The new index and metadata files are saved to the correct output directory

## Implementation Notes

The feature extraction pipeline was run on the full dataset, and the FAISS index was rebuilt successfully. The server now uses the new index.
