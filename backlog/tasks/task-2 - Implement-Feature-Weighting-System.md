## Description

Introduce a configurable weighting system to balance the influence of different feature types (e.g., color, content) in the final feature vector. This will allow for tuning the matching algorithm without changing the core feature extraction.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A configuration file is created to define weights for each feature component
- [ ] The feature construction process reads these weights and applies them
- [ ] The server's query logic is updated to use the same weighting system

## Implementation Notes

Implemented a configurable feature weighting system. The system reads weights from a JSON file and applies them during feature extraction. The server has been updated to use this new logic.
