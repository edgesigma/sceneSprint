## Description

To improve match accuracy, this task will replace the global color histogram feature with a regional histogram approach. The image will be divided into a 2x2 grid, and a separate histogram will be calculated for each quadrant. These will be concatenated into a single feature vector, preserving spatial color information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The feature extraction script is updated to use the regional histogram method.
- [ ] The FAISS index is rebuilt using the new
- [ ] larger feature vectors.
- [ ] The server is updated to handle the new feature vector size.
- [ ] Match quality is qualitatively assessed to be improved.
